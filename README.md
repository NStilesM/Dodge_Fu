# React_Fu

## Overview

* React Fu will be a relative clone of the [One Finger Death Punch](https://youtu.be/R1j0VE6d-xE?t=7)


* My App will allow a player to defend theirself against projectiles from both sides. Specific keys on a keyboard must be pressed at a specific time to destroy incoming projectiles.

### MVPS
1. General layout with central character
2. Projectiles, Randomness and origin from both sides
3. Destruction of Projectiles given response.
4. Visual display of different projectiles and background
5. Fight music implementation
Bonus: Response movement of the central character 

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs

Pure Javacript to generate the game mechanics.
Will use canvas elements to render and move the center character as well as the arrows over time. Will use collision detection with the "attack squares" of the center character.
JS animate will be used as well.
